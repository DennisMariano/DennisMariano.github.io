# CHARATHERS

### *Manjiro "Mikey" Sano is the boss and the presedent of the gang called tokyo Manji Gang, Mikey founded Tōman in 2003 during his first year of middle school. He founded it along with five of his friends; Ryūguji "Drakken" Ken, Mitsuya Takashi, Hayashida "Pah-chin" Haruki, Baji Keisuke, and Hanemiya Kazutora.

### *Ken "Draken" Ryuguji Like the president, vice-president Draken is also quite the wild individual. He loves a good fight and relishes meeting strong opponents. He is rude to those he considers beneath him and makes it clear he does not like them.

### *Takemichi hanagaki  is completely loyal to those he considers his friends and fiercely protective of them. He is willing to risk his very life to ensure that they are safe and sound. This loyalty spurs his determination to create a better future for the ones he cares about. This is shown through his countless leaps back in time to change the gruesome outcome of his loved ones.

### *Taiju Shiba a prideful individual, he has absolute and justified confidence in his fighting ability, being capable of besting several powerful fighters with relative ease and with the strength and fighting skill to back it. An effective leader since a young age, he has been able to capitalize on both his strength and height, greater than that of his peers to exercise power with impunity. Rather than use indiscriminate violence to achieve his goals, Taiju learned how to utilize it in more precise and strategic ways, delivering savage beatings to adversaries in ways that allowed him to garner support, granting him a special kind of charisma. His ability to weaponize brutality is best evidenced on the Black Dragons themselves, whom he was capable of reforging into an extremely dangerous and feared gang of street fighters, giving them a niche as bodyguards for hire for wealthy individuals

### *Yuzuha Shiba Yuzuha is a caring and energetic person in addition to being a responsible sister, as shown by her always taking the blame even though her little brother, Hakkai, was usually the culprit (albeit innocent mistakes). Her devotion to her younger brother is so big, she was even willing to kill their older brother, Taiju, in order to take vengeance for their miserable life and him taking away Hakkai's position as member of the Tokyo Manji Gang.

### *Hakkai Shiba is shown to be a timid but friendly guy. When it comes to his personality, he is nothing like his older brother, Taiju, who is disciplined and bloodlusted. Hakkai showed a lot of care and compassion to his sister and to his friends, he was even willing to take the blame for the murder of Taiju so that Yuzuha didn't have to suffer the consequences. Hakkai also gave up the comfort of being in Toman in order to help Takemichi escape from Black Dragon. He is very old-fashioned when it comes to his mannerisms and honor, feeling as if he owes Takemichi his life by calling him "Onjin" which translates to "A person who you owe your life to."

### *Chifuyu Matsuno is a loyal person who sports a calm, logical demeanor. He is unwilling to leave the sides of his friends and refuses to fight those he considers close to him. He is willing to let his emotions shine when a situation calls for it and doesn't shy away from helping out others blindly. Even if he gets beat up by or for friends, he still sticks by their sides. He typically acts as an adviser for Takemichi and makes plans before jumping into action. He's usually composed under high-pressure situations that might even cost him his life. Though he acts knowledgeable and levelheaded, he is naive at times and doesn't always plan things meticulously, which has lead to unfortunate consequences at times.

### *Takashi Mitsuya is a calm level-headed person who once served as the main source of positivity in Tokyo Manji Gang. Despite his rough upbringing, he tackles every day with a smile. Mitsuya is a pacifist, preferring to not get into an altercation if possible, but at the same time, will not hesitate to fight to protect what is dear to him.He has shown an angrier side to him, getting frustrated at Takemichi when he was losing and told him to stay focused.He cares for his two younger sisters, Luna and Mana, acting as both their mother and father since their mother is rarely at home due to work.
